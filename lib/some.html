        <p><a>Introduction</a></p>
        <p><span>M</span>y bags were packed and my provisions loaded. I was ready for adventure. And so, on a late
            summer afternoon, I dragged my reluctant friend Drew off to explore new worlds and, I hoped, to find some
            happiness along the way. I’ve always believed that happiness is just around the corner. The trick is finding
            the right corner.</p>
        <p>Not long into our journey, Drew grew nervous. He pleaded with me to turn back, but I insisted we press on,
            propelled by an irresistible curiosity about what lay ahead. Danger? Magic? I needed to know, and to this
            day I’m convinced I would have reached wherever it was I was trying to reach had the Baltimore County Police
            not concluded, impulsively I thought at the time, that the shoulder of a major thoroughfare was no place for
            a couple of five-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Some people acquire the travel bug. Others are born with it. My affliction, if that’s what it is, went into
            remission for many years following my aborted expedition with Drew. It resurfaced after college with renewed
            fury. I desperately wanted to see the world, preferably on someone else’s dime. But how? I had no marketable
            skills, a stunted sense of morality, and a gloomy disposition. I decided to become a journalist.</p>
        <p>As a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, I traveled to places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and
            Indonesia: unhappy places. On one level, this made perfect sense. Unconsciously, I was observing the
            first law of writing: Write about what you know. And so, notebook in hand, tape recorder slung over my
            shoulder, I roamed the world telling the stories of gloomy, unhappy people. The truth is that unhappy
            people, living in profoundly unhappy places, make for good stories. They tug at heartstrings and inspire
            pathos.</p>
        <p>They can also be a real bummer.</p>
        <p>What if, I wondered, I spent a year traveling the globe, seeking out not the world’s well-trodden trouble
            spots
            but, rather, its unheralded happy places? Places that possess, in spades, one or more of the ingredients
            that we consider essential to the hearty stew of happiness: money, pleasure, spirituality, family, and
            chocolate, among others. Around the world, dozens of what-ifs play themselves out every day. What if you
            lived in a country that was fabulously wealthy and no one paid taxes? What if you lived in a country where
            failure <em>is</em> an option? What if you lived in a
            country so democratic that you voted seven times a year? What if you lived in a country where excessive
            thinking is discouraged? Would you be happy then?</p>
        <p>That’s exactly what I intended to find out, and the result of this admittedly harebrained experiment is the
            book you now hold in your hands.</p>
        <p>I was born in the Year of the Smiley Face: 1963. That’s when a graphic designer from Worcester,
            Massachusetts, named Harvey Ball invented the now-ubiquitous grinning yellow graphic. Originally, Ball’s
            creation was designed to cheer up people who worked at, of all places, an insurance company, but it has
            since become synonymous with the frothy, quintessentially American brand of happiness.</p>
